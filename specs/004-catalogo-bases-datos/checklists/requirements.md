# Specification Quality Checklist: Catálogo de Bases de Datos

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2026-08-07
**Feature**: [specs/004-catalogo-bases-datos/spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Notes

- All checks passed. The specification is based on the already fully decision-closed enriched user story
  (`userStory/enriched/2026-08-06-catalogo-de-bases-de-datos-user-story.md`), so no [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]
  markers were required.
- The endpoint path (`GET /api/v1/admin/bases-datos`) is referenced in requirements/acceptance scenarios
  for testability, consistent with the same convention already used in
  `specs/003-catalogo-ambientes-desarrollo/spec.md`.
- The specification is ready for the planning phase.
